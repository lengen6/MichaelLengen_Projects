            <h2>Matt House</h2>
            <p>
                Matt was an All-American collegiate wrestler at The Ohio State University. After completing his degree
                he found Jiu Jitsu and immediately fell in love with the sport. He is a brown belt and has been training
                Jiu Jitsu for the past 7 years. He specializes in the standup game and quick and efficient takedowns.
                When you roll with Matt or any of his proteges you need to be on your toes or you will soon find
                yourself on your back.

                Bob Robertson
            </h2>
            <p>
                Bob “Squared” Robertson began his martial arts journey at 12 years old with Kodokan Judo, eventually
                receiving his black belt at age 20. His friend introduced him to Jiu Jitsu 4 years ago and he has never
                looked back, now the proud holder of a purple belt. His Gi throws, takedowns, and grip fighting are
                second to none and he enjoys passing his skills on to a new generation. Outside of the gym Bob enjoys
                painting and competing in triathlons.
