            <h2>The Mats</h2>
            <p>
                Our facility is housed in a converted warehouse split into two sections. One for mats and another for
                weights/cardio. Our mats area is quite spacious with enough space for 20 students at one time. This
                includes enough room to safely conduct live takedowns and sparring with the full 20 students. The mats
                are thick to ensure safety and cleaned before and after each practice to ensure cleanliness. We also
                conduct monthly inspections to guarantee that they are in perfect working order and when they are not we
                replace them promptly.

                The Weights
            </h2>
            <p>
                In addition to the mat area where our classes are conducted, we also have a full strength and
                conditioning section. We believe that while technique is paramount any martial endeavor, by definition,
                requires a strong and healthy body to be fully effective. Towards this end, we have a full weight room
                with squat racks, benches, free weights, spinning bikes, rowing machines, sleds, and many other pieces
                of fitness equipment. We also have staff that are knowledgeable and can instruct students in the proper
                and effective use of our equipment.

                The Staff
            </h2>
            <p>
                Our staff consists of four coaches from a variety of backgrounds who come together to make sure our
                studentsâ€™ education is well rounded. Between us we have experience at the highest levels of wrestling,
                Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, Judo, weightlifting, and Yoga. While we are a Jiu Jitsu school, we believe that
                the modern Jiu Jitsu practitioner is increasingly an amalgam of effective grappling techniques from
                around the world thus our coaches and teaching philosophy reflect this.

            <h2>The Location</h2>
            <p>
                We are located just of the Elyria/Sheffield exit of I-90 on Detroit Rd. nearby Lorain County Community
                College and the surrounding shopping area. We have found that this location is convenient for many of
                the residents of Lorain County. We draw many students from the college as well as professionals who live
                or work in the area.
