        <h2>
            Is Jiu Jitsu Safe?
        </h2>
        <p>
            Compared with other combat sports Jiu Jitsu is much safer because it does not involve striking (with the
            exception of self defense jiu jitsu but even then it is not live striking). As such there is a much lower
            incidence rate of things such as concussions, broken noses, and split lips.
            This being said there is always the potential for injury with any sport especially when competing and giving
            your all. The most common injuries include, sprains, bruises, and in extreme circumstances broken bones.
            This can sound off putting at first but in reality, is no different than any other sort of sport, non combat
            included.

            Several key factors in remaining safe are choosing your sparring partners well, knowing when to tap, warming
            up properly, and stretching adequately.

        <h2>
            Is there any equipment required for Jiu Jitsu?
        </h2>
        <p>
            Like pretty much all sports and hobbies there are a few things that are needed/recommended. For Gi
            classes/competition you need to have a Gi and belt, these usually run anywhere from $50 to $100 dollars. For
            no Gi form fitting athletic clothes without pockets are all that is required. Additionally, it is highly
            recommended that mouthguards are used while live sparring or “rolling” as it is known. Headgear is also
            optional but not widely used.

        <h2>
            Is Jiu Jitsu effective for self defense?
        </h2>
        <p>
            While it is more commonplace now in the US for Jiu Jitsu to be sport oriented and focused it does have its
            roots in self-defense and combat. Our school is competition focused but we do periodically (as well as
            upon request) offer classes in self defense focused Jiu Jitsu. A simple expanation of the difference is that
            self defense is focused on Jiu Jitsu vs. No Jiu Jitsu with a small focus on strikes and how to avoid them
            whereas the sport form is focused on Jiu
            Jitsu vs. Jiu Jitsu with no striking.

        <h2>
            How does the belt system work and how long does it take to get each belt?
        </h2>
        <p>
            There are 5 commonly used belts in Jiu Jitsu, from lowest to highest: White, Blue, Purple, Brown, Black. A
            red or a red and white "coral" belt also exists but is reserved for only the most knowledgeable grandmasters
            whose impact on jiu jitsu is without compare. Progression varies from person to person, but on average it
            takes 2 to 3 years training twice a week to achieve each belt. Belt progression is based on a combination of
            time, knowledge of technique, performance during live sparring ("rolling"), and competition results.

        <h2>
            Am I required to participate in tournaments and competitions?
        </h2>
        <p>
            While we are a competition focused school and genuinely believe in the power and motivation of sport, it is
            by no means required to compete nor will it prevent you from progressing in you Jiu Jitsu journey. To each
            their own!
