# Final Capstone

The Final Capstone starter code comes with two separate projects:

1. Java (with pom.xml and database scripts) for your backend Spring Boot code
2. A Vue project already configured and ready to go.

To install the database, navigate to the `database` folder inside the java project and following the instructions found in the Instructions.txt file. The scripts will create and initialize your final_capstone database for you and set you up with the default users.


IMPORTANT!!!

Always start your backend server first BEFORE starting Live Server. The Spring Boot server must start on port 8080. If you start Live Server AFTER Spring loads, Live Server will start on port 8081.   If you do not do this, your Spring Boot server will fail to launch with a 'port already in use' error.
